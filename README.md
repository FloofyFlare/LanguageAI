# cf_ai_language_tutor

An AI-powered language tutoring tool that helps students practice foreign languages through voice and chat. Built entirely on Cloudflare infrastructure using Nuxt, Supabase, and a combination of cutting-edge AI models.

## üß† Overview

This project combines speech recognition, LLM-powered tutoring, and voice synthesis to create an immersive language learning experience. Students can speak or type in their target language, receive intelligent feedback, and hear corrected responses‚Äîall in real time.

### üîß Tech Stack

- **LLM**: `gpt-4o-mini` (OpenAI) for conversational tutoring and grammar correction  
- **Speech-to-Text**: `whisper-large-v3` for accurate multilingual transcription  
- **Text-to-Speech**: Google Cloud AI TTS for natural voice responses  
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3 (Vue-based framework)  
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)  
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages + Workers for CI/CD and edge execution
